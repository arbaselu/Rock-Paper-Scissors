Project #1: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 

Welcome to my first programming project, the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors! This project represents a significant milestone in my learning journey as it is a culmination of the skills I have developed while solving various logic problems.

Installation

To run this game, you need a C compiler installed on your system. This project has been developed and tested using GCC.

Linux

To install GCC on Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu):

Copy code

sudo apt update

sudo apt install build-essential

Windows

For Windows, you can use MinGW or Cygwin to install GCC. Alternatively, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a great option for running native Linux applications on Windows.

Compilation

After installing a compiler, open a terminal in the project directory and run:

Copy code

gcc main.c -o rockpaperscissors

This will compile the source code into an executable named rockpaperscissors.

Usage

To run the game, open a terminal and execute:


Copy code

for Linux: ./rockpaperscissors ,for Windows: rockpaperscissors 

Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the computer.

Contributions are always welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the game, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
